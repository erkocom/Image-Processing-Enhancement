# Image Processing - Enhancement
 This project encompasses various image processing techniques implemented to enhance underexposed photographs.

Image enhancement is a technique used to obtain better quality in terms of clarity and brightness of an image, and to provide comfort for the human eye. There are different types of techniques to achieve good quality of an image. Global image contrast enhancement is one of the most commonly used techniques to improve the quality of an image, but it has a disadvantage in that it does not consider the local details of an image. The local details of an image are very important in the analysis of scientific studies of an image, such as an image taken from the surface of a planet, satellite imagery, and medical images. The local details of an image are crucial for diagnosing a specific disorder. When local contrast enhancement or global contrast enhancement is used alone, the brightness of the image is lost. In order to address and reduce this inconsistency of individual enhancement methods, this article presents a new method that uses both local and global enhancement methods on the same image. First, the image is enhanced locally, and the output is then processed by the global enhancement method, thus obtaining an appropriately enhanced image without losing the brightness of the image. This enhancement method has been simulated in Python, and the results have been validated on image quality parameters.
